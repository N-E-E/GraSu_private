# GraSU: A Fast Graph Update Library for FPGA-based Dynamic Graph Processing

## Introduction

GraSU is a graph-structured update library for high-throughput dynamic graph updates on FPGA. GraSU can be easily integrated with any existing FPGA-based static graph accelerators for handling dynamic graphs. We implement GraSU on Xilinx Alveo U250 FPGA card (real hardware).
